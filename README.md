## Activity
The first we have done is going through the website and then we planned and decided to distribute the parts, roles, and the responsibility to each one and we supported each other by clearing the queries that others have.

    
## Mastering

we learned a lot of things in this project, this helps us to deepen our knowledge and understanding of issues. we were exposed to a variety of perspectives. And improved our vocabulary. we learned how to teach and manage personalities. and learned to listen to other suggestions which may be better than ours and also learn how to work with them.
